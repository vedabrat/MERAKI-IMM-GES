Ensuring Connectivity and Security of Educational Institutions 

To thrive in today’s digital world, educational institutions need connectivity and security. The European Commission foresees that by 2025, all schools should have access to gigabit internet connectivity because it would be necessary to access up-to-date resources or heavy-bandwidth online learning platforms. As schools throughout Europe increasingly rely on digital learning, users need access to a high-speed internet connection. 

With my IT connectivity and security solution, I need to:

Stay Ahead of Security Threats

You need a top-notch surveillance system. Sensors can be used to monitor a wide range of events and alert school authorities when an area has been accessed by an unauthorized person. Smart cameras not only help identify and eliminate security blind spots, but they also detect and investigate threats in real-time. School administrators are also able to monitor network activity in real-time so if suspicious behaviors or viruses are detected, IT teams can remotely authenticate endpoints via a cloud-based dashboard.
